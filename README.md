# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

This code example demonstrates the Chain of Responsibility pattern using a technical support system analogy.

## Description

Consider a technical support system in a company. When a customer submits an issue ticket, it might pass through multiple levels of support - Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 - each with varying expertise. Level 1 support might handle common issues, but if the problem is more complex, it gets escalated to Level 2 or Level 3 support. Each level decides whether to resolve the issue or escalate it to the next higher level. This tiered structure represents a Chain of Responsibility, where each level represents a handler deciding to handle the issue or pass it to the next level.

## Key Components

- **Handler Interface (ISupportHandler):** Defines the interface for handling support tickets and contains a method to set the next handler.
- **Concrete Handlers (Level1Support, Level2Support, Level3Support):** Concrete implementations of the handler interface. Each handler decides whether to handle the support ticket or pass it to the next level.
- **Client (SupportSystem):** Represents the system that generates support tickets and starts the chain by passing the ticket to the first handler.

## Usage

The client generates a support ticket and sends it to the initial handler. The handlers decide whether to handle the ticket or escalate it to the next level until the issue is resolved or reaches the highest level.

## How to Run

Compile and run the C# program to simulate the support ticket system.

## Purpose

The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows decoupling of senders and receivers of requests by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. It avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object the chance to handle the request.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how the Chain of Responsibility pattern manages the flow of requests through a chain of handlers.
